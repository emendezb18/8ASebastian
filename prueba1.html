            <h3><U>Global alliances:</U></h3>
        <p>Other countries chose sides with either the U.S  or the Soviet Union, and thy formed alliances like the NATO which was an alliance of countries that supported the U.S and alliance of countries that supported the Soviet Union was the Warsaw pact. These alliances were very useful to the countries because the other countries would give the country supplies and anything that they needed.</p>

            <p>There were a lot of proxy wars which was sort of like a non direct war, and these kinds of wars and sort of useless because they arent representing their country they are just fighting to kill the soldiers and people from the rival country.Because of the proxy wars there were a lot of political struggles like the Korean and Vietnam war. </p>

        <h3><u>Collapse of the Soviet Union:</u></h3>
        <p>The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, started a lot of econom1ic struggles, nationalist movements,and it  marked the end of the Cold War. The failed coup attempt in 1991 made the central Soviet government weak, and that led to the declaration of independence of many republics. Then Gorbachev resigned and the dissolving of the Soviet Union resulted in the emergence of the Russian Federation and a transformed global geopolitical landscape.</p>

<p>The conflict was caused after WWII where the Soviet Union still had some issues with the US. In 1948 the Soviet Union became a fully left government, being completely communist. The cause of the war was also the Soviet Union controlling Western Europe.</p>
